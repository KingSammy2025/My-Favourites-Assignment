      For me personally, i love sleeping a lot because it makes me feel
      refreshed, i rarely get sleep and i can game more because im not always
      tired. Here are some healthy benefits of sleeping:

      <li>Stay at a healthy weight.</li>
      <li>
        Lower your risk for serious health problems, like diabetes and heart
        disease.

        Think more clearly, form long-term memories, and do better in school and
        at work.
